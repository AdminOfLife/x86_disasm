Requires C11 compiler, like GCC >= 4.7.

Libraries required:
* octothorpe (available at https://github.com/dennis714/octothorpe)

Use absolute paths in 'configure' script, e.g.:

=================================================
configure --enable-debug=yes 
--with-octothorpe-include=/cygdrive/c/P/octothorpe/include 
--with-octothorpe-lib=/cygdrive/c/P/octothorpe/build/lib
=================================================

If --with-octothorpe=DIR is set, octothorpe headers will be searched in DIR/include and library
file in DIR/lib.

If no options supplied, headers will be searched in /usr/local/include/octothorpe and library
file in /usr/local/lib.

* Recommended build:

=================================================
mkdir build
cd build
../configure
make
make check
[sudo] make install
=================================================

Thus, the headers files are goes to /usr/local/include/x86_disasm and library file to /usr/local/lib.

* Debug build:

=================================================
mkdir build
cd build
../configure --enable-debug=yes
make
make check
[sudo] make install
=================================================

* Shared library:

This library is compiled as static by default.
Use "--enable-shared" to make shared library.

* MinGW:
